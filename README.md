## Create a simple todo list site. Below are the basic features it should have.

 1.As a user, I should be able to see a navigation bar with todo application name and username. </br>
No authentication and user management required. Just display some username.</br>
 2.As a user, I should be able to see default todo list items loaded from a json file asynchronously. </br>
This json file should have multiple todo list objects. Each object should have title, todo item, author and date properties.</br>
 3.As a user, I should be able to create new todo item using an input area. </br>
This need not be persisted on the server/database. You can refer any todo app online but you should provide the reference.</br>
